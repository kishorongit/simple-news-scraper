# 📰 Simple Web Scraper for News Headlines

A beginner-friendly Python project to fetch and display news headlines from online news websites.  
This project demonstrates **web scraping**, **HTML parsing**, and **clean documentation** practices.

---

## ✨ Features

- Fetch web page content using `requests`.
- Parse HTML for headline elements (`<h2>`, `<h3>`).
- Display headlines in a clean, numbered list.
- Error handling for invalid URLs or failed requests.
- (Optional) Export results to a file.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) – for HTTP requests
- [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) – for HTML parsing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kishorongit/simple-news-scraper.git
cd simple-news-scraper
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or manually:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

### 3. Run the Scraper

```bash

## 🤝 Ethical & Responsible Scraping

Before using this project or extending it further, it’s important to understand the **responsibilities of web scraping**:

### ✅ Best Practices

- **Check the Terms of Service (ToS):** Many websites explicitly restrict automated scraping. Always review their ToS before scraping.
- **Respect `robots.txt`:** Most sites provide a `robots.txt` file (e.g., `https://example.com/robots.txt`) which indicates which parts of the site can be accessed by bots.
- **Prefer APIs when available:** Many news outlets (e.g., New York Times, The Guardian) provide official APIs for developers. Using these is safer and more reliable than scraping HTML.
- **Throttle requests:** Avoid overwhelming servers. Use delays (`time.sleep()` in Python) and limit the number of requests per second.
- **Identify your scraper:** Always set a custom `User-Agent` string so site administrators can understand who is making requests.
- **Cache data:** If you need repeated access to the same content, store it locally instead of hitting the website multiple times.

### ⚠️ Things to Avoid

- **Bypassing blocks or CAPTCHAs:** Techniques like rotating proxies or automated CAPTCHA solving may violate ToS and even legal regulations.
- **Commercial redistribution of scraped data:** Headlines and articles are usually copyrighted. Redistribution may require licensing.
- **High-frequency scraping:** Flooding a website with requests can degrade its performance and potentially get your IP banned.

### 🎯 Rule of Thumb

- For **learning and personal projects**, scraping public headlines or RSS feeds in moderation is generally fine.  
- For **production or commercial projects**, always seek permission, check licenses, or use official APIs.
